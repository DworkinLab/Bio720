#Introduction to Programming with R

 We do not have enough "in class" time to really develop all of the `R` programming skills necessary to enable you to independently perform analysis of differential expression using RNAseq data. Therefore, most of the activities will be self-guided, using a combination of video tutorials and practical exercises. It is expected you will have done all of these for class, as we will be doing a larger in class set of activities assuming a basic level of comfort and familiarity.

Readings: From Bioinformatics Data Skills, chapter 8 presents a crash course in programming in `R`. We will not be using any of the functionality in `ggplot2` quite yet, so you can skip those pages (207-215, 224-227). I suggest that reading a bit, going through the relevant video tutorial & exercises, and then moving onto the next component may work best.
