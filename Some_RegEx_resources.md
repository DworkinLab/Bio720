# Some resources to get started with regular expressions

- The [interactive exercises](https://regexone.com) at regexone.com are a very good place to get your feet wet. I definitely recommend starting here.

- This is a [different interactive tutorial](https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285) that I think is somewhat complementary.

- Also check out the resources including interactive exercises [regexinfo.com](http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html) regexinfo.com

- Also here for checking how your Regular expressions are working in real time. http://regexr.com/

- Here are two nice regular expression cheatsheets, [here](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/courses/27610/regular-expressions-cheat-sheet-v2.pdf) and [here](https://remram44.github.io/regex-cheatsheet/regex.html). Pick one of them, and print it out! It is useful to have a binder of your programming cheatsheets!
