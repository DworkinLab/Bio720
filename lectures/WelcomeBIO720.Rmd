# Welcome to BIO720

## Introductions
- Dr. Ben Evans  
- Dr. Brian Golding  
- Dr. Ian Dworkin

- All y'all

## Learning Objectives for the course
- develop fundamental computational skills necessary for modern biological research 

- Open the door for you to develop your computational skills for your needs (genomics, bioinformatics, simulations, image analysis..)  

- Organizing your research around principles of reproducibility

## What this course is not
- Genomic analysis course. Covered in BIO722.

- Bioinformatics class.

- A computer science course.

- A statistics course. BIO708.

## Course organization and assignments

BG, BE...

## Topics
- Reproducible Research, literate programming and science (ID)

- Introduction to the UNIX command line (BG)

- Introduction to R programming (BE)

- Putting it all together (a few examples in bioinformatics, genomics and maybe image analysis?)

## Break

## What is reproducible research

## Literate programming

Literate programming just means combining the computer code with an explanation of what and how you are doing something in a natural language. 

[The wikipedia page is pretty good for this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)

## R markdown

- Many ways of achieving this

- At least while working in R we will use R markdown via Rstudio.

- Combines code snippets (R, python, c++, bash) with a very simple markup language (called markdown) that is human readable, and can be rendered.

## R markdown

Let's do a few examples.


## version control
What's wrong with this?

## Version control
- version control enables you to organize and keep track of changes to all kinds of documents, including data and code!!

- We will use git in this class (next week)

## Organizing project structure
```bash
/ProjectName
  ./data
  ./scripts
  ./outputs
  ./misc
  ./manuscript
  README
```
