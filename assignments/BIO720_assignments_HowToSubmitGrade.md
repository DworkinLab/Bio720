# BIO720 Assignments on emailing instructions

 Upon completion of your assignment create a _single_ pdf with
  your answers.
- Name the pdf file with your student number (and nothing else).
- Mail the file to Brian "at"" Golding "at" McMaster "dot" CA (please fix the email address, this is done this way say BG does more spam email), 

Use the subject header: "Biology 720 Assignment"
(no quotes around the subject header)

Brian will collect the assignments and when they have all been
received ...

- you will receive back in your email another student's file to mark and an answer sheet.
- When you return the marked assignment to Brian put a mark (out of 100) in the subject header e.g. "Marked 720 Assignment - xx/100"
- Annotate the pdf with the mark in the pdf itself along with
  whatever feedback, comments you can give to your fellow student.
