# BIO720 Final Assignment

Due Date: December 14th, 5PM.

## Datacamp modules

1. Please complete "String Manipulation with stringr in R" and either the "Introduction to Bioconductor in R" **OR** "Writing Efficient R Code" course. Provide an image demonstrating completion. You also need to do the tutorial on "https://regexone.com/",  although I don't think there is any formal way of demonstrating you completed it (but I promise it will be helpful)


## Questions

**PLEASE NOTE** This assignment needs to be written as an Rmarkdown file (.Rmd), which is what you will be submitting for your answers. It is your responsibility to make sure that the document can be "knit" properly (to html)
