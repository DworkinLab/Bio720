# R assignment number two due October 28th (DataCamp) and Monday October 29th, 2018.

Please note. All assignments should be done in R-markdown unless otherwise specified. I recommend submitting the .Rmd file and the .html file for me. Once we have introduced github you will also be able to do just provide the link to the .Rmd and .md files for me to look at things.

Here is a [link](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) to an R-markdown cheatsheet (i.e. summary of useful and common commands).


1. Please Do the following DataCamp activities. Expect these to take a total of 6-8 hours. This part of the assignment is due Sunday, October 28th at 11:59PM. No need to email me that it is done, I get an automatically generated report.

 - Complete the "Intermediate R - Practice" course (distinct from the Intermediate R course you already have done).
 - Do the first two chapters in the "Importing Data into R (Part 1)" course (these are chapters "Importing data from flat files with utils" & "readr & data.table
 - Do the first chapter ("Basic Workflow") in the course "Introduction to git for Data Science".
 - DO the first chapter ("authoring R Markdown Reports") in the "Reporting with R markdown" course.

 2. Install *git* on your local computer, and make your first github repository (repo). It can contain pretty much anything (I suggest a simple txt or markdown file with something like "hello world" in it). Send me the link to the repo once you have generated it. This is due **before** class next week (6PM Monday)
 Git can be installed from [here](https://git-scm.com/), but I recommend following the github tutorials ([here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) to set up git and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) to make your first repository). Chapter 5 in your textbook also introduces these ideas pages 67-73 and then 83-87.
