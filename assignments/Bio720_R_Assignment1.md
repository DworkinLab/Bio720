For October 21st (DataCamp) and October 22nd (2018):
1. Complete **Introduction to R** on DataCamp (By 11:59PM Sunday October 21st)
2. Complete **Intermediate R** on DataCamp (By 11:59PM Sunday October 21st)
3. Make sure you have installed the current version of `R` and `R studio`. See the installation instructions above. To confirm you can open `R` in R studio and run

```{R}
sessionInfo()
Sys.info()[["user"]]
require(rstudioapi)
versionInfo()
```
then copy the information that is rendered as a PDF and email it to Dr. Golding (along with the information for question 4 below).

Note: Some people may (not sure why) not have the `rstudioapi` package already installed. If it gives you an error about this you can install it (and then re-run the code above). i.e.

```{R}
install.packages("rstudioapi")
```

and then re-run the set of commands.

4. Sign up for a Github account (see installation instructions).
5. (optional) Try to install Git (see installation instructions)
6. (optional) If you really want to be ahead of the curve get git set up with R studio and github (http://happygitwithr.com/). We will do this later.

For some getting Git installed and set up will work exactly like it is described in the tutorial. For others you will have difficulties and will need to use your highly honed google schools and Zen like calm to get it working. This is the first stage in computational skills is to get programs installed and working, and is often the most tricky part!
