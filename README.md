# Bio720

## Course Summary
This is the page for Bio720 (2016), a practical introduction to fundamental computational skills for biologists. This is taught through the Biology Department at McMaster University, but most course materials are freely available to anyone interested.

## Class time and location
TBD. First organizational meeting will be held in the Life Sciences Building (LSB) room 213A
(off the lounge) at 2:00-2:30pm Friday September 7th, 2018.

## Background assumed for students
For this class we are not assuming students have background in programming/scripting, nor in bioinformatics. We do assume that students have a working knowledge of basic molecular biology and genetics and have basic familiarity with using computers. i.e. you can figure out 

# What students will need
A laptop with internet access and the ability to install several programs (in particular, `R`, `Python` and a shell emulator in not using a Mac (OS X) or linux.

## Course goals
The primary goal of this course it to provide graduate students an opportunity to develop the basic, fundamental computational skills necessary to go on and (in the future) develop the appropriate (and more advanced) skills for bioinformatics, genomics, etc.

## Learning Objectives

# Topics (some TBD)
1. Introduction to UNIX and the command line. (Brian)
  1. Introduction to basic shell commands, logging onto remote systems

2. Fundamentals of programming using `R`(Ian). [Link to R portal for class](https://github.com/DworkinLab/Bio720/blob/master/Introduction_to_R.md)
  1. Fundamentals of programming in R.
  2. How to avoid repetive strain injury while programming. Control flow in R. Using the `apply` family of functions in `R`. Simple  simulations.
  3. Working with data in `R`. Getting data in. Data munging (subsetting, merging, cleaning). Working with strings in `R`.
  4. Basics of plotting in `R`. Other topics TBD.

3. Fundamentals of program using `python`. (Brian).

## Recommended books.
You are responsible for ordering your own copies of these books. Both are excellent, but we are only highly recommending the first book (PCfB) for this class.

[Practical Computing for Biologists](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_24?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=practical+computing+for+biologists&sprefix=practical+computing+for+biologists%2Caps%2C144). This book provides a nice, gentle introduction to the basic computational skills all biologists should have. In particular, with introduction to using the UNIX command line, shell scripting, basic `python` programming, regular expressions, working on remote machines and a few other topics. The book is written to be agnostic with respect to discipline (i.e. it is not a bioinformatics book *per se*), but does a great job of being both very accessible and immediately useful. It seems a bit pricy on Amazon.ca, but look around for used copies (it is 4 years old). If you plan to continue in computational research, this is a fantastic resource.

[Bioinformatics Data Skills](http://www.amazon.ca/Bioinformatics-Data-Skills-Reproducible-Research/dp/1449367372/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1440614667&sr=1-1&keywords=bioinformatics+data+skills). **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** This is a new book, but which fills an important gap in that is oriented towards the day to day skills for anyone working in the fields of genomics and bioinformatics. In addition to covering the basic UNIX skills (and why we use UNIX in bioinformatics and genomics), it also covers subjects like overviews of the essential file types (`.fasta`, `.fastq`, `.gff`, etc) that are ubiquitous in the field. There is also a nice, but brief introduction to the essentials of `R`, using bioconductor and in particular range data, and two important chapters on how to organizing (and maximize reproducibility) of computational projects. Currently this is ~52$ on Amazon. It is available as an [e-book as well from the publisher](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do).
