## Recommended books (not required, but these may be helpful). We will let you find copies of these (i.e. via amazon, or used book sellers) if you think they would be useful.
[Practical Computing for Biologists](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_24?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=practical+computing+for+biologists&sprefix=practical+computing+for+biologists%2Caps%2C144). This book provides a nice, gentle introduction to the basic computational skills all biologists should have. In particular, with introduction to using the UNIX command line, shell scripting, basic Python programming, regular expressions, working on remote machines and a few other topics. The book is written to be agnostic with respect to discipline (i.e. it is not a bioinformatics book per se), but does a great job of being both very accessible and immediately useful. It seems a bit pricy on Amazon.ca, but look around for used copies (it is 4 years old).


[Bioinformatics Data Skills](http://www.amazon.ca/Bioinformatics-Data-Skills-Reproducible-Research/dp/1449367372/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1440614667&sr=1-1&keywords=bioinformatics+data+skills). This is a new book, but which fills an important gap in that is oriented towards the day to day skills for anyone working in the fields of genomics and bioinformatics. In addition to covering the basic UNIX skills (and why we use UNIX in bioinformatics and genomics), it also covers subjects like overviews of the essential file types (`.fasta`, `.fastq`, `.gff`, etc) that are ubiquitous in the field. There is also a nice, but brief introduction to the essentials of `R`, using bioconductor and in particular range data, and two important chapters on how to organizing (and maximize reproducibility) of computational projects.
