2. Assign the value ` 25 ` to the variable ` y `.
3. Assign the value of ` x ` to the variable ` y `.
4. Before printing it out, think about what the current values of ` x ` and ` y `.
5. What are the values of ` x ` and ` y` (check).
6. Now assign assign ` x ` a new value of ` 10 `.
7. Has the value of ` y` changed? Why or why not?
8. Check the value of ` y `.
