# R exercise 4

0. Just in case you are not starting with a fresh session of `R`, remove all objects currently in your workspace with the following command:
```R
rm(list=ls())  
``` 
1. concatenate all of these strings (characters in `R`) into a single object with the variable name `a` with 4 elements:
  - `GeneA GeneB GeneC GeneD`
2.  What is the mode atomic type (mode) of `a`? How about its class?
3. How do you check the length of each element in `a`? Why does `length(a)` not work in this case?
4.  In the screen cast I do not go over a few important classes that we will get to later (list, factor, data.frame). How would you go about getting some information on each of these classes (and do so for at least one)?
5. What are some of the important *attributes* of objects with class `matrix` in `R`?
