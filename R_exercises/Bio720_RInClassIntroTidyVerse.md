# Introduction to the *tidyverse*

This is currently just a stub as I decide how to teach this given I have already introduced the students to base R data munging, apply family functions, etc..



## data munging the tidy ways
- dplyr, reshape2, tidyverse

## functional programming with `purrr`
- Using `purrr` instead of the apply family.
- use datacamp functions and functional programming tutorials?
- in particular show the map family for each atomic type.

## model summaries with broom (?)


## plotting the ggplot2 way?
- Should I do a tutorial, or just have them do the datacamp tutorials?
