# `R` exercise 3

1. Create a vector ` a` with 5 numbers.
2. Create a vector `b` with 6 numbers.
3. What happens when you add `a` and `b`?
4. overwrite `b` and make it a vector with 5 numbers (to correspond to the length of `a`).
5. Which elements of `a` are greater than the corresponding element of ` b`?
6. Which elements of `a` are less than or equal to the corresponding element of `b`?
7. What is greater, the mean of `a` or the mean of `b`?
8. What is smaller, the standard deviation of `a` or `b`?
9. Make a new variable `ab` storing the sum of the concatenated vector of `a` and `b`. What is the length of `ab`?
10. Make a new variable `C ` and assign it the matrix created from the column vectors of `a` and `b`.
11. What is the class of `a`? of `C`?
12. What is the mode (attribute of object, not measure of central tendency) of `a`? of `C`?
13. Explain the difference between the mode of an object and the class of an object?
