# R exercise 5

0. If you are not working with a fresh R instance, then use the command:
```R
rm(list=ls()
```
1. Can you explain how the command above works? You may wish to look at the help file of `ls`.
2. Why might you want to save a workspace in `R`? What are the advantages over just saving the script of commands to run the analysis?
3. Create several new variables (does not really matter what the variables are storing). Then save the workspace.
4. quit `R`
5. Re-open `R` and then load your workspace. Check to see if the variables you created are still there.
6. How might you look for help on the assignment operators?
